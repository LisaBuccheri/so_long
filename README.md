# so_long
so long gave us a grounding in the following skills: 
  - window management,
  - event management,
  - color and texture selection.
We also got to grips with the school's graphics library: the MiniLibX. This library has been developed in-house and includes basic tools for opening windows, create images and manage keyboard and mouse events.
The objectives of this project were similar to those of your first year: to demonstrate rigor, improve your C programming skills, use basic algorithms, search for information independently, etc. ...
